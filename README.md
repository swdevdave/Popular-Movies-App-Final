## Description
Stage 2: Trailers, Reviews, and Favorites
  
### User Experience  
In this stage you’ll add additional functionality to the app you built in Stage 1.  
  
You’ll add more information to your movie details view:  
  
- You’ll allow users to view and play trailers (either in the youtube app or a web browser).  
- You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.  
- You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*.  
- You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection. 

# Requirements
- App requires an API KEY from https://www.themoviedb.org.
